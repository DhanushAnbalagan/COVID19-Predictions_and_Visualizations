COVID-19 Predictions and Visualizations
This repository contains data science work related to COVID-19 predictions and visualizations, created using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and various data science libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to understand trends, make predictions about future cases, and visualize the findings. The analysis includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization of key trends
Prediction modeling using machine learning

Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations to illustrate the trends in the COVID-19 data. Some key visualizations include:

Line plots showing the number of new cases, recoveries, and deaths over time.
Bar charts comparing the total cases across different regions.
Heatmaps illustrating the correlation between different variables.

Results
The results of the analysis and predictions are documented in the Jupyter Notebook, with detailed explanations and insights derived from the data.
